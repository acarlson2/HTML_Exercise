      <h1>Aaron</h1>
      <p>
        I am 21 years old. I go to Carthage College in Kenosha, WI.
        I am a major in Computer Science and a minor in Music.
        My hobbies include playing video games, singing, and hanging
        out with my family. My favorite video game series is Pokemon.
        It's a game that I've been playing since I was young.

        I looked down at the board. "The <strong>point</strong> isn't to win?" I asked. "The
        <strong>point</strong>," <span style ="color:blue">Bredon</span> said grandly, "is to <u>play</u> a <em>beautiful</em> game." He lifted
        his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into a beautific smile. "Why
        would I want to win anything other than a <em>beautiful</em> game?"
